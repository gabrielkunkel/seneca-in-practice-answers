# Seneca in Practice solutions

My own solutions for [Seneca In Practice](https://github.com/senecajs/seneca-in-practice/tree/master/problems).
It was lots of fun!


## I learned how to

- [X] use variables in npm scripts.
- [X] create save, list, get, and update data on the memory store, which can be MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc. Seneca has a built-in ORM as part of its mem-store plugin.
- [X] make my own plugins.
- [X] override .add method and/or .wrap all of them in a handler that processes all client actions that match the pin using a "prior" method.
- [X] share behavior between Seneca microservices.


## Node School

I highly recommend [node school](https://nodeschool.io/). They have a vaste collection of JavaScript tutorials.
